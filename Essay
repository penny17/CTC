Contemporary Trends in Communication Essay "Digital World is more real than the offline version?"

This question has grown its relevancy since the social networks had a boom. The use of this media became revolutionary as it has been proven that helps to the sense of belongness of many people. It provides a platform for those whose tiny voice in the physical world hasn't been heard. This kind of innovation responds to the needs of both, the very specific groups of people and the big picture in society. Innovation is an interactive process, the new product meets the new needs of people and viceversa, the new product evolves because of the participation and use of the consumers (Prahalad and Ramaswamy, 2004; Vargo and Lusch, 2004; von Hippel, 2005). A new technology and system like social media meets the new need of participation that the human has.
